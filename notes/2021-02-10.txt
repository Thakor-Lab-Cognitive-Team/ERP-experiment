2021-02-10 Testing TENS parameters
Author: Ze Ou

Tested stimulation of the parm using param: 

duration = 3; % duration of stimulation in sec
delay = 1; % delay after stimulation in sec
freq = 5; % frequency in Hz
PW = 1; % pulse width in ms
amp = 2; % amplitude in mA

It felt like something was hitting against my hand, I was able to feel 
the individual pulses and there is no prick feeling unlike other locations
including the wrist and the elbow.

Upon further sensory mapping, I changed the params to:
duration = 3; % duration of stimulation in sec
delay = 4; % delay after stimulation in sec
freq = 2; % frequency in Hz
PW = 0.7; % pulse width in ms
amp = 0.90; % amplitude in mA

This change lightened the impact felt by the hand. It does not feel like
getting hit by a rock anymore, but more of a light tap

The feelings are discrete, so I doubt changing the frequency would be
perceived as changing the intensity of the stimulation but just as more
frequent impact, therefore I would argue that changing the pulse width
would actually change the perceived intensity of the signal

Thus, I am gonna vary the pulse width and plot a psycophysics curve

Yes, I tested using PW = [0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9]. The curve itself is not
completely sigmoidal because the outcome is [0 0 0.5 1 1], but if we shrink
the range of pulse width tested, then we will sure get a good sigmodal
function
