The trigger pins from the green arduino box are connected to digital
pins 8, 9, and 10.

All 8 pins of the trigger parallel port need to connect to ground before
the first trigger is issued. Otherwise, only one trigger can be used at 
a time. Disconnected pins are read as 1's by the EEG system. Therefore, if
pin 7 is connected, the rest state is 01111111, and then since the value is
inverted, the rest state is 10000000. Then when pin 7 is output high, the 
readout is 11111111, after inversion it becomes 00000000, which sets the
ground state for the EEG system. Next, when the output goes low, the
readout becomes 10000000, thus output a 128 event marker on the screen.
